## Power Plant Performance Analysis Report

This repository contains a Power BI report designed to analyze the performance of power plants. The report provides insights into key metrics such as installed capacity, generation, utilization, and efficiency, broken down by various factors like energy source, technology, and location. It serves as a demonstration of data analysis and visualization skills within the Power BI environment, with a focus on the energy sector.

**Report Overview**

The report is structured to provide a comprehensive view of power plant operations, including:

* **Overall Performance:** Key metrics like total installed capacity, total generation, and overall utilization.
* **Efficiency Analysis:** Analysis of average efficiency across different categories.
* **Generation and Utilization Relationship:** Visualizing the correlation between power generation and utilization.
* **Plant Details:** Detailed information about individual power plants, including location, energy source, technology, and capacity.
* **Geographical Analysis:** Interactive maps (Bubble Map, Heat Map) to visualize capacity, generation, and plant distribution by country.
* **Plants with no generation:** Identifies plants that are installed but have not generated power.
* **Plants requiring expansion:** Identifies plants with very high utilization that may need expansion.
* **Least used plants:** Identifies plants with very low utilization.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Highlighted:**

* **Installed Capacity (MW):** The maximum power output a plant can produce.
* **Generation (MW):** The actual power output of a plant.
* **Utilization (MW):** The amount of installed capacity that is actually used.
* **Utilization %:** The percentage of installed capacity that is utilized.
* **Average Efficiency:** A measure of how effectively a plant converts fuel into electricity.

    * Examine the tables for detailed plant-level data.

**Key Insights (Based on Sample Data)**

Based on the sample data, some potential insights include:

* [Example: Hydro power plants have the highest average efficiency (85%).]
* [Example: Germany has the highest total generation, significantly exceeding other countries in the dataset.]
* [Example: There is a positive correlation between Generation and Utilization. ]
* [Example: The report identifies several plants with very high utilization that may be candidates for expansion to meet increasing demand.]
* [Example: The report also highlights plants with little to no generation, which may warrant further investigation into the reasons for their underperformance.]

**Important Notes**

* The data provided in this repository is sample data for demonstration purposes. It may not reflect real-world power plant data with complete accuracy.
* The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase Power BI skills and the ability to analyze energy-related data.
